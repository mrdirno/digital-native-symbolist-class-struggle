  "cover_prompt": "A young man with a data-ghost shimmering in his tear duct, his ears plugged with ornate, corporate-issued sonic dampeners, reaches out to touch a decaying concrete wall from which vibrant, forbidden symbols bleed like digital moss, in the rain-slicked, neon-drenched alley of a towering megacity. The scene is dense with layered meaning: glitching holographic advertisements for \"Clarity™\" and \"Semantic Security\" cast reflections on puddles, while in the shadows, hand-painted resonant glyphs—the archive of the mute—pulse with a faint, warm light on grimy walls, creating a stark visual war between sterile corporate light and organic, resistant glow. In the atmospheric style of Simon Stålenhag and Moebius, blending melancholic futurism with intricate, symbolic detail. Book cover framing, a centered and intimate composition looking up at the protagonist from a low angle, emphasizing the oppressive scale of the city against his solitary act of connection. Cinematic chiaroscuro lighting with stark contrasts between the cold, electric blues and purples of the city and the warm, ethereal golds and ambers emanating from the resonant symbols. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."

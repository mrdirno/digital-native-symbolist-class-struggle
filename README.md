## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a forgotten public artwork (a mosaic, a mural, a sculpture) that 'wakes up' and communicates a hidden truth about the neighborhood's history.
- Create a profile for a 'Data Theologian'—what do they believe, what tools do they use, and who hires them?
- Draft a message from 'The Liminal' forum, using a mundane list or notice to encode a secret call to action.
- Imagine a 'resonant relic' not mentioned in the text. Describe its appearance, where it was found, and what silent message it holds.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a conceptual 'Symbolist Toolkit': a set of open-source, low-tech tools (software or physical) for capturing, analyzing, or amplifying residual meaning in objects and places.
- Propose a 'Resonance Map' of a city block: a method for visually layering the historical, social, and corporate symbolic meanings onto a standard street map.
